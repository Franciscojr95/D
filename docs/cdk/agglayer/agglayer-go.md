## Overview

The Agglayer Golang service is a web service designed to receive zero-knowledge proofs from various CDK chains, verify their soundness, and send them to L1 for final verification.

!!! warning
    This service is now deprecating in favor of the more robust and efficient [Rust implementation](agglayer-rs.md).

## Architecture

The AggLayer Golang architecture supports interactions with multiple CDK chains for ZKP verification. 

It uses PostgreSQL database for storage and interacts with both L1 and L2 chains through configured RPC nodes.

The diagram below shows the full start up, running, and shutdown sequence for the application and its components.

## Get started

### Run locally with Docker

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/AggLayer/agglayer-go
    ```

2. Execute the following command:

    ```bash
    make run-docker
    ```

## Production set up

1. Ensure only one instance of Agglayer is running at a time.
2. Use a containerized setup, or OS level service manager/monitoring system, for automatic restarts in the case of failures.

### Prerequisites

#### Hardware

- For each CDK chain it's necessary to configure it's corresponding RPC node, synced with the target CDK. 
- This node is for checking the state root after executions of L2 batches.
- We recommend a durable HA PostgresDB for storage, preferably AWS Aurora PostgreSQL or Cloud SQL for PostgreSQL in GCP.

#### Software

- Docker
- Docker Compose

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/AggLayer/agglayer-go
    ```

2. Install Golang dependencies:

    ```bash
    go install .
    ```

### Configure key signing 

1. Install `polygon-cli`:

    ```bash
    go install github.com/maticnetwork/polygon-cli@latest
    ```

2. Create a new signature:

    ```bash
    polygon-cli signer create --kms GCP --gcp-project-id gcp-project --key-id mykey-tmp
    ```

3. Install `gcloud` CLI and set up ADC:

    ```bash
    gcloud auth application-default login
    ```

4. Configure `KMSKeyName` in `agglayer.toml`.

### Configure `agglayer.toml`

* `[FullNodeRPCs]` to point to the corresponding L2 full node.
* `[L1]` to point to the corresponding L1 chain.
* `[DB]` section with the managed database details.
